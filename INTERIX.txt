Notes on Interix (the Windows POSIX subsystem):

1. You will get tons of .pdb and .ilk files if you use MSVC. Remove them when you clean.
2. Use GNU Make (until I can de-crapify the Makefile).
3. MSVC seems to ignore the #pragma pack directives in headers.h.
4. Necessary modifications have been made to support GCC 3.3 and 4.24.
